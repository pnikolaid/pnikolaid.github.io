In what follows, I briefly describe my last two papers on network slicing. <br/>

In network slicing, the customer and the network operator sign an agreement. This agreement specifies the QoS delivered to the network slice of the customer, and the price that the customer needs to pay in exchange.

Due to these agreements, we argue that sharing resources between network slices solely based on utility maximization schemes is not enough. Splitting the resources based on proportional or max-min fairness means little to the customers. Their only concern is whether they are receiving the promised QoS that they are paying for.

Instead, the operators need to first monitor the resources that each network slice needs over time. Then, they can provision resources and charge each customer accordingly.
