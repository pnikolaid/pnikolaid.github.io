I'm a fifth year PhD candidate at the deparment of Electrical and Computer Engineering at the University of Maryland. I'm also a member of the Institute for Systems Research. I'm fortunate to be advised by Prof. John Baras. Before joining the PhD program in 2019, I received my diploma in Electrical and Computer Engineering at the Aristotle Univerisity of Thessaloniki in Greece.

# Research Interests

I'm broadly interested in communication networks. Currently, my research focus is on network slicing. My goal is to develop a framework that provides QoS guarantees to multiple network slices at the same time while efficiently adapting their network resources to traffic. In my research, I often use various tools from Dynamic Programming, Learning Theory, and Estimation Theory. In general, I like to mix theory with practice whenever possible by proposing clear solution approaches and then implementing them on simulators and testbeds for experimentation. 


_From February to May, I'll be visiting Prof. James Gross' group at the KTH Royal Institute of Technology in Sweden._
