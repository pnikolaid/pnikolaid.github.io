# About

I'm a 5th year PhD candidate in the [Deparment of Electrical and Computer Engineering](https://ece.umd.edu/) and a member of the [Institute for Systems Research](https://isr.umd.edu/) at the [University of Maryland](https://umd.edu/). My advisor is Prof. [John Baras](https://ece.umd.edu/clark/faculty/357/John-S-Baras). Before joining the PhD program, I earned my Diploma in Electrical and Computer Engineering  at the [Aristotle Univerisity of Thessaloniki](https://www.auth.gr/en/university/) in Greece.

# Research Interests

I'm broadly interested in communication networks. Currently, my research focus is on network slicing. My goal is to develop a framework that provides peformance guarantees to multiple network slices efficiently via dynamic resource adaptation. 

My research draws from Controls, Queueing Theory, Learning Theory and Estimation Theory. In general, I like to mix theory with practice by formulating problems of practical interest and implementing their solutions on simulators or testbeds. 

# News

From February to May 2024, I'll be a visiting researcher at the [KTH Royal Institute of Technology](https://www.kth.se/en) in Sweden, hosted by Prof. [James Gross](https://www.jamesgross.org/).
