I'm a 5th-year PhD candidate at the Deparment of Electrical and Computer Engineering at the University of Maryland. I'm also a member of the Institute for Systems Research. I'm fortunate to be advised by Prof. John Baras. Before joining the PhD program, I received my diploma in Electrical and Computer Engineering at the Aristotle Univerisity of Thessaloniki in Greece.

# Research Interests

I'm broadly interested in communication networks. Currently, my research focus is on network slicing. My goal is to develop a framework that provides QoS guarantees to multiple network slices concurrently while adapting their resources to traffic for increased efficiency. In my research, I often use various tools from Control Theory, Queueing Theory, Learning Theory and Estimation Theory. In general, I like to mix theory with practice whenever possible by proposing clear problem formulations and then implementing their solutions on simulators or testbeds for evaluation.
