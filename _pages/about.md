# Short Bio

I'm a fifth year PhD candidate at the Deparment of Electrical and Computer Engineering at the University of Maryland, where I'm also a member of the Institute for Systems Research. I'm fortunate to be advised by Prof. John Baras during my PhD. Before joining the PhD program, I received the Diploma in Electrical and Computer Engineering at the Aristotle Univerisity of Thessaloniki in Greece.

# Research Interests

I'm broadly interested in communication networks. Currently, my research focus is on network slicing. My goal is to develop a framework that provides QoS guarantees to multiple network slices at the same while efficiently adapting the network resources to traffic. In my research, I like to mix theory with practice whenever possible. 


From February 1st to May 31st, I'll be visiting Prof. James Gross' group at the Royal Institute of Technology (KTH) in Sweden.
