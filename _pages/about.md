I'm a 5th-year PhD candidate at the [Deparment of Electrical and Computer Engineering](https://ece.umd.edu/) at the [University of Maryland](https://umd.edu/). I'm also a member of the [Institute for Systems Research](https://isr.umd.edu/). I'm fortunate to be advised by Prof. [John Baras](https://ece.umd.edu/clark/faculty/357/John-S-Baras). Before joining the PhD program, I received my diploma in Electrical and Computer Engineering  at the Aristotle Univerisity of Thessaloniki in Greece.

# Research Interests

I'm broadly interested in communication networks. Currently, my research focus is on network slicing. My goal is to develop a framework that provides QoS guarantees to multiple network slices concurrently while adapting their resources to traffic for increased efficiency. In my research, I often use various tools from Control Theory, Queueing Theory, Learning Theory and Estimation Theory. In general, I like to mix theory with practice whenever possible by proposing clear problem formulations and then implementing their solutions on simulators or testbeds for evaluation. 

U+2709	From February to May, I'll be visiting Prof. James Gross' group at the KTH Royal Institute of Technology in Sweden.
