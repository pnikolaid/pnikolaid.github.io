# About
I am a Network System Researcher in the Department of Mobile Network Systems at [Nokia Bell Labs](https://www.nokia.com/bell-labs/) in Murray Hill, New Jersey, where I have been working since 2025. Before that, I earned my Ph.D. in Electrical and Computer Engineering at the [University of Maryland](https://ece.umd.edu/) in 2024, under the supervision of Prof. [John Baras](https://ece.umd.edu/clark/faculty/357/John-S-Baras). Prior to my doctoral studies, I received my Diploma in Electrical and Computer Engineering from the [Aristotle Univerisity of Thessaloniki](https://www.auth.gr/en/university/) in 2019.

# Research Interests
My goal is to design and build intelligent network systems that can efficiently support emerging applications such as autonomous driving, augmented reality, robotics and Internet of Things. Towards this goal, I often leverage tools from Optimization, Controls, Estimation Theory and Machine Learning. Briding theory with practice, I formulate problems of practical interest and implement their solutions on network simulators and testbeds. 

During my Ph.D. studies, my work centered on 5G network slicing. I developed a framework that provides peformance guarantees to multiple network slices efficiently via dynamic resource adaptation. My framework also considers bilateral service level agreements which can be used to isolate and protect customers from anomalous network slices via hypothesis testing. I have implemented and tested several of my algorithms in cellular testbeds such as Amarisoft and OpenAirInterface 5G. 

At Nokia Bell Labs, my recent research has expanded to intelligent handovers for V2X applications and mobility-aware network slicing. I am currently working on deploying these features as rApps/xApps within the O-RAN architecture.
