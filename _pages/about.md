# About
I am a Network System Researcher in the Department of Mobile Network Systems at [Nokia Bell Labs](https://www.nokia.com/bell-labs/) in Murray Hill, New Jersey since 2025. Before that, I earned my PhD in Electrical and Computer Engineering at the [University of Maryland](https://ece.umd.edu/) under the supervision of Prof. [John Baras](https://ece.umd.edu/clark/faculty/357/John-S-Baras) in 2024. Before joining the PhD program, I earned my Diploma in Electrical and Computer Engineering  at the [Aristotle Univerisity of Thessaloniki](https://www.auth.gr/en/university/) in 2019.

# Research Interests
My goal is to design and build intelligent network systems that can efficiently support emerging applications such as autonomous driving, augmented reality, robotics and Internet of Things. Towards this goal, I often leverage tools from Optimization, Controls, Estimation Theory and Machine Learning. Briding theory with practice, I formulate problems of practical interest and implement their solutions on network simulators and testbeds. 

Currently, my research focus is on 5G network slicing. During my PhD, I have been developing a framework that provides peformance guarantees to multiple network slices efficiently via dynamic resource adaptation. My framework also considers bilateral service level agreements which can be used to isolate and protect customers from anomalous network slices via hypothesis testing. I have implemented and tested several of my algorithms in cellular testbeds such as Amarisoft and OpenAirInterface 5G. More recently, at Nokia Bell Labs, I have been working on intelligent handover mechanisms for V2X applications and on mobility-aware network slicing methods. My objective is to implement such methods as rApps/xApps within the O-RAN architecture.
